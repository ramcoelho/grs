Welcome do Grs.

This project aims to ease the implementation of a service layer using REST.

Make sure to configure your environment by listing the parent directories for Grs on include_path (php.ini).
This project depends on URL rewrite (mod_rewrite).

How you use it:

To create a REST service on some context (an arbitrary directory inside web root):
	http://www.server.com/context/
simply create a .htacess on context's real path like this:

/var/www/context/.htaccess:
	<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule . grs.php [L]
	</IfModule>

and, in the same directory, the grs.php stated on RewriteRule, above:

/var/www/context/grs.php:
	<?php
	require 'Grs/controller/Grs.php';
	$grs = new Grs();
	$grs->setModelsPath('my/model/path/');
	$grs->dispatch();

change $grs->setModelsPath to reflect your model classes path, and that's it!

Try
    http://www.server.com/context/Class1/method1/param1/param2.json
    
which will result in:

    1. Require a file called Class1.php which should reside in my/model/path.
    2. Instantiate an object of Class1
    3. Call a method named method1 from the newly created object, passing
       an array of two values: 'param1' and 'param2'
    4. Encode the result inside an JSON object
    5. Send it back to the browser
    
You may also use different extensions, like xml and txt.
